"In animated Disney movies, people fall in love without even knowing each other. In The Little Mermaid, all Prince Eric knew about Ariel was that she was an attractive redhead with the upper-body strength to pull him safely to shore when his boat capsized. And he loved her for that? In Cinderella, the heroine falls for the prince because he can dance and makes an effort to return lost items to their rightful owner. Seems a little shallow, if you ask me.",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"You should interview 37 percent of the candidates and then pause. Identify the best person from this first group. Now you have a meaningful benchmark. After evaluating the first 37 percent, you should be prepared to hire the first candidate who is better than the standout from the first group. This logic applies to dating, too. Apply the rule of 37 percent to that time period. In the book Algorithms to Live By, authors Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths discuss a single man who wants to get married. Assuming that his search would run from ages eighteen to forty, the 37% rule gave age 26.1 as the point at which to switch from looking to leaping."" Now it's your turn. To determine your dating window,  count the number of years from when you started dating to when you'd like to enter a long-term relationship. Now, what's 37 percent of that number? Add that to the age when you started dating. That's your 37 percent mark.""",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"While we instinctively prefer reversible decisions to irreversible ones, this flexibility often make us less happy in the long run.

"If youâ€™re not going on dates, youâ€™re not getting closer to knowing the kind of person you want to be with long term.

And you canâ€™t work on any of these skills if youâ€™re sitting around by yourself, preparing."" The only way to get better at it is to actually date. Once youâ€™ve set the deadline, start doing the pre-dating work. Download the apps. Assemble a few solid date outfits. Consider going to an improv class to learn how to listen carefully and play well with others. Pay attention the next time youâ€™re having dinner with a friend: How much are you focusing inward (How am I coming across?) versus really listening and being curious (What is this person trying to communicate?)?""",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"Some babies showed signs of distress as soon as their mother left. When she returned, these babies would be temporarily soothed and stop crying but then angrily push the mother away and begin crying again. Ainsworth called these babies anxiously attached."" Another group of babies cried when their mother left but stopped as soon as she returned. They quickly resumed playing. These were the ""securely attached"" babies. A third group did not respond to their mother leaving the room; nor did they acknowledge her when she returned. They pretended they werenâ€™t bothered by the situation, but the researchers could tell from their elevated heart rate and stress levels that these babies were just as upset as the ones who cried. These were the ""avoidantly attached"" babies.""",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"Those are the securely attached babies, who felt confident their mothers would meet their needs. People with a secure attachment style make ideal partners. Theyâ€™re reliable and trustworthy. They tend to avoid drama and, if not, are able to defuse it when they see it coming. Theyâ€™re flexible, forgiving, and good at communicating. They behave consistently. They create healthy boundaries. Theyâ€™re comfortable with intimacy. People with secure-attachment styles end up reporting higher levels of relationship satisfaction than avoidant or anxious folks.""""",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury

"When weâ€™re younger and we enter a relationship, itâ€™s like a start-upâ€”two people coming together to build something. Weâ€™re more flexible and still figuring out what we want. When weâ€™re older and thinking about long-term relationships and, eventually, marriage, the process is more like a merger: two complete beings coming together. The older we get, the more set in our ways we are, and the more we crave someone who will easily fit into our lives. We assume that the more similar we are, the easier the merger will be. But that assumption is wrong.",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"Expecting our partners to fulfill all our needs puts a lot of pressure on relationships. OSOs help alleviate that pressure. Think of it this way: If you try to pile dozens of hats on one personâ€™s head, the pile (and maybe the person) will topple over. Instead, you can give the baseball cap to your sports-loving cousin and call her when you want to talk RBIs. You can give the cowboy hat to your friend who loves country music and make plans with him the next time you want a two-stepping partner. When youâ€™re in a relationship, hereâ€™s how you can incorporate OSOs into your life. Consider what roles youâ€™ve asked your partner to play that they are uninterested in fulfilling: for example, insisting they go to a party with you when they much prefer smaller gatherings. Or wishing your partner would suggest visits to museums and art galleries when itâ€™s just not their thing. Remember, just because they donâ€™t share all your interests doesnâ€™t make them a bad partner! And for those roles your partner isnâ€™t suited for, find a friend or family member who can fill in. In the long run, this will make you happier because your needs are being met. And it will make your partner happier because they can focus on roles that match their skills and interests.",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury

"Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Some identity capital goes on a rÃ©sumÃ©, such as degrees, jobs, test scores, and clubs. Other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselvesâ€”bit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay

"The urban tribe is overrated. For the past decade or so, there has been much talk about the urban tribe, or the makeshift family that has come to the fore as twentysomethings spend more years on their own. Sitcoms and movies tout the value of the tribe, the fun of having a place to go with that store-bought pumpkin pie when we canâ€™t make it home-home"" for Thanksgiving, how nice it feels to have a group to call our own. Without a doubt, these friends play a crucial, supportive role for many twentysomethings, and they provide lots of good times. Essentially the college buddies of the twentysomething years, the urban tribe, are the people we meet up with on the weekend. They give us rides to the airport. We vent about bad dates and breakups over burritos and beer. With all the attention paid to the urban tribe, however, many twentysomethings have limited themselves to huddling together with like-minded peers. Some are in almost constant contact with the same few people. But while the urban tribe helps us survive, it does not help us thrive. The urban tribe may bring us soup when we are sick, but it is the people we hardly knowâ€”those who never make it into our tribeâ€”who will swiftly and dramatically change our lives for the better.""",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
"Because theyâ€™re not just figures in an already ingrown cluster, weak ties give us access to something fresh. They know things and people that we donâ€™t know. Information and opportunity spread farther and faster through weak ties than through close friends because weak ties have fewer overlapping contacts. Weak ties are like bridges you cannot see all the way across, so there is no telling where they might lead.",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
"In-group members share more than slang and vocabulary. They share assumptions about one another and the world. They may have gone to the same schools or have the same ideas about love. Our strong ties probably all watch Glenn Beck or Rachel Maddow or Stephen Colbertâ€”or they decidedly do not. Whatever the particular sources of sameness, hanging out with them can limit who and what we know, how we talk, and ultimately how we think. Weak ties, on the other hand, force us to communicate from a place of difference, to use what is called elaborated speech. Unlike restricted speech, which presupposes similarities between the speaker and the listener, elaborated speech does not presume that the listener thinks in the same way or knows the same information. We need to be more thorough when we talk to weak ties, and this requires more organization and reflection. There are fewer tags, such as ya know"" and sentences are less likely to trail off at the end. Whether we are talking about career ideas or our thoughts on love, we have to make our case more fully. In this way, weak ties promote, and sometimes even force, thoughtful growth and change.""",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
"Most twentysomethings yearn for a feeling of community, and they cling to their strong ties to feel more connected. Ironically, being enmeshed with a group can actually enhance feelings of alienation, because we—and our tribe—become insular and detached. Over time, our initial feeling of being part of a group becomes a sense of disconnection with the larger world.",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
"True interconnectedness rests not on texting best friends at one a.m., but on reaching out to weak ties that make a difference in our lives even though they don’t have to. When weak ties help, the communities around us—even the adult community that twentysomethings are warily in the process of entering—seem less impersonal and impenetrable. Suddenly, the world seems smaller and easier to navigate. The more we know about the way things work, the more we feel a part of things.",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
"We imagine that if people like us, then they do us favors because this is how it works in the urban tribe. But the Ben Franklin effect, and subsequent empirical studies, show it works the other way around with people we know less well. If weak ties do favors for us, they start to like us. Then they become even more likely to grant us additional favors in the future. Franklin decided that if he wanted to get someone on his side, he ought to ask for a favor.

"I once had a fortune cookie that read A WISE MAN MAKES HIS OWN LUCK. Perhaps the single best thing we can do to make our own luck in our twenties is say yes to our weak ties or give them a reason to say yes to us. Research shows that our social networks narrow across adulthood, as careers and families become busier and more defined. So—even and especially as we job-hop and move cross-country and change roommates and spend our weekends about town—this is the time to be connecting, not just with the same people having the same conversations about how work is lame or how there are no good men out there, but with those who might see things a little differently.

"There is a classic study in psychology known as the jam experiment. The jam experiment was conducted by a researcher named Sheena Iyengar who, then at Stanford University, had the idea that the local grocery store would be an excellent place to understand how people make choices. Iyengar’s research assistants posed as jam suppliers and set up sampling tables at a gourmet store. In one condition of the experiment, six flavors of jam were available for tasting: peach, black cherry, red currant, marmalade, kiwi, and lemon curd. In another condition, twenty-four flavors of jam were featured: the six flavors just mentioned plus eighteen others. In both conditions, customers who tasted the jam could then use a coupon to buy a jar at lower cost. The key finding in the study was that the twenty-four-flavor table attracted more attention yet it resulted in fewer buyers.",The Defining Decade,Meg Jay
