"The Romanticizer has unrealistic expectations of relationships. They want the soul mate, the happily ever after—the whole fairy tale. The Maximizer has unrealistic expectations of their partner. They love to explore their options and want to feel absolutely confident they’re making the right decision. The Hesitater has unrealistic expectations of themselves. They feel like they’re not ready to date.",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
"In animated Disney movies, people fall in love without even knowing each other. In The Little Mermaid, all Prince Eric knew about Ariel was that she was an attractive redhead with the upper-body strength to pull him safely to shore when his boat capsized. And he loved her for that? In Cinderella, the heroine falls for the prince because he can dance and makes an effort to return lost items to their rightful owner. Seems a little shallow, if you ask me.",How to Not Die Alone,Logan Ury
